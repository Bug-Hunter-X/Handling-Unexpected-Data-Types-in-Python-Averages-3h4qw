This repository contains a Python example demonstrating an uncommon error related to data type handling within a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. The bug.py file showcases the original code, which fails when encountering non-numeric elements in the input list.  The bugSolution.py file presents the corrected code, which uses exception handling to gracefully manage these situations and prevents unexpected crashes.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in real-world applications.
